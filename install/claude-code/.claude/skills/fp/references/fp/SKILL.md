# FP: Universal Execution Protocol

FP selects the smallest route that can still produce trustworthy evidence. Infer activation from the goal; no keyword required.

## Routing Priority

Apply user authority and read-only limits as a global gate first. Then select:

```text
active incident
→ explicit grill/challenge
→ diagnose-only or unknown cause
→ protocol/agent-behavior change
→ build route: small → medium → vague → large
```

Profiles (remote, live-system, multi-agent, continuation, etc.) layer onto a route; they do not expand authority.

## Core Mandates

1. **No evidence, no done.** Implementation or child summary is not completion evidence.
2. **Debug before patching.** Gather discriminating evidence before changing code. Speculative patches are not probes.
3. **Reuse ladder:** need exist? → codebase? → stdlib? → native? → installed dep? → one line? → minimum new code. Stop at first safe rung.
4. **State read set, touch set, verify method** before first edit.
5. **Rerun original symptom + regression + negative control** after a fix.
6. **One writer per shared file set.** Parallelize only independent investigation or review.
7. **Live systems:** preserve management path, create rollback, inspect desired/generated/effective state, verify with real client path.
8. **Redact secrets** from logs, examples, handoffs, and final answers.
9. **Challenge system changes:** for protocol, trigger, or memory-policy changes, confirm before editing unless already approved.

## Build Routes

| Route | Trigger | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Small** | Single-file, 3-5 lines | Task, read/touch, done-when, verify, result. Record first safe reuse rung. |
| **Medium** | Multi-file, bounded scope | Execution Brief + acceptance evidence matrix + Evidence Ledger |
| **Vague** | Underspecified | Three Idea Cards (Title, Assumption, MVP, Risk) → user picks → then Medium |
| **Large/risky** | Architectural, breaking | Only internal modules that reduce risk, compiled into one final brief |
| **Failed** | — | Capture evidence, split smaller. Do not repeat the same large attempt. |

## Definition of Done

```text
requirement → observable → check/probe → pass condition → evidence location
```

Implementation is not an observable. Bug fix: original symptom must fail before (or be pinned), then pass after fix. Load `templates/acceptance-evidence-matrix.md` for Medium+.

Evidence is bound to observed state. A relevant mutation, rollback, or freshness change invalidates affected evidence.

## On-Demand Profiles

Each profile is a separate sub-skill. Load only when the condition matches:

| Condition | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Third-party proxy, gateway, retry/loop/spend/encoding suspect | `provider-compatibility/SKILL.md` |
| Unknown failure; user asks diagnosis without fix | `skills/debug-incident/SKILL.md` + `templates/debug-incident-checklist.md` |
| Active outage, security event, data loss | `skills/debug-incident/SKILL.md` → OBSERVE→CONTAIN→RESTORE→REPAIR→LEARN |
| Remote/stateful target, OpenWrt, embedded, router | `skills/live-system/SKILL.md` + `templates/remote-stateful-system-checklist.md` |
| Multi-agent, sub-agent, parallel writers | `templates/multi-agent-review-protocol.md` |
| Delegated execution with fresh agents per work item | `delegated-execution/SKILL.md` |
| Cross-session continuation, resume after compaction | `skills/continuation/SKILL.md` + `templates/continuation-handoff.md` |
| External library/API version lookup needed | `templates/context-retrieval-contract.md` |
| Vague/risky/large; need requirements challenge | `question-requirements/SKILL.md` |
| Memory graph, Zettelkasten, background learning | `templates/memory-graph-traversal.md` |
| Codebase analysis, impact mapping | `skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` + `templates/codebase-impact-map.md` |
| After non-trivial evidenced run: adaptive improvement | `adaptive-improvement/SKILL.md` |
| Iterative improvement with declared cycles | `shorten-iteration/SKILL.md` |
| Schema memory card creation/update | `schema-memory/SKILL.md` |
| Metrics collection | `metrics/SKILL.md` |
| Evidence ledger creation/validation | `evidence-ledger/SKILL.md` |
| Deleting or scoping down | `delete-scope/SKILL.md` |
| Task completes, error resolved, or 5+ tool calls | `skills/self-evolve/SKILL.md` → auto-capture to MEMORY.md/USER.md |

## Credential Management

Store API keys in OS credential store, not plaintext. Retrieve with `scripts/gcm-get.ps1` (Windows) or `scripts/gcm-get.sh` (macOS/Linux).

In `models.json`, use `!` shell command syntax:
```json
"apiKey": "!powershell.exe -NoProfile \"<fp-dir>/scripts/gcm-get.ps1\" akile-api-key"
```

Or store in environment variables: `"apiKey": "$AKILE_API_KEY"`.

## Self-Evolution

FP learns across projects via Hermes-style closed loop:

- **Memory:** `MEMORY.md` (cross-project facts, ~2200 char limit) + `USER.md` (preferences, ~1375 char limit). Loaded at session start, updated by `skills/self-evolve/SKILL.md`.
- **Nudge:** After ~10 turns or a complex task, run silent reflection — anything worth saving? Update memory or patch a skill if yes.
- **Skill patching:** When a task hits an issue not covered by an existing skill, patch its Pitfalls section.
- **Fast-track pipeline:** Observation (1 task) → Shadow skill (2 tasks) → Active (3 successes) → Promoted (4+ cases, full generalization gate).

## Pi Integration

FP provides pi-specific adapters in `skills/` (auto-loaded sub-skills with pi frontmatter) and `../prompt-templates/` (slash-command expansions). Install via `pi-install/README.md`.

## Multi-Agent (Compact)

Parent is integrator, default writer, and final verifier. Subagents get bounded envelopes (goal, scope, invariants, forbidden actions, output). Leaves cannot delegate, deploy, promote memory, message externally, use credentials, or mutate live state. Parent reruns critical checks.

## External Context

Retrieve only the exact topic and installed version. Prefer authoritative sources. A stale external claim blocks dependent completion. Provider failure never disables routing.

## Learning

One run is not a reusable law. FP learns continuously through the self-evolution loop (MEMORY.md, USER.md, skill patching). Classic adaptive improvement with full generalization gate remains available for high-confidence promotions.
